# EnvUp

EnvUp is a simple command line application that tries to go a little bit further than your average dotfile manager. On top of managing your dotfiles, EnvUp can install packages from APT and run scripts. The goal is to get your customized environment up and running with a single command. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
